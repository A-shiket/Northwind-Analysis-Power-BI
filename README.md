# Northwind Interactive Dashboard

## Project Overview
This project analyzes the Northwind dataset, a fictional database that includes information about sales, customers, products, orders, employees, and shippers. The goal of this analysis is to evaluate the companyâ€™s performance, uncover actionable insights, and present them through an interactive Power BI dashboard. Key focus areas include revenue trends, customer behavior, and operational efficiency.

The final dashboard is designed to provide stakeholders with an intuitive, user-friendly tool for exploring key business metrics and making data-driven decisions.

## Dependencies
This project uses:
- **Power BI Desktop**: For data transformation, modeling, and visualization.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this analysis is the **Northwind Traders dataset**, a classic sample dataset for learning and practicing business analytics. It includes information about:
- Sales
- Customers
- Products
- Orders
- Employees
- Shippers

## How I Approached the Project

### Understanding the Dataset
- Explored the dataset to understand its structure and available information.
- Identified key focus areas like revenue trends, top customers, and shipping performance.

### Data Preparation
- Cleaned and transformed the data directly in Power BI.
- Handled missing values, created calculated columns like **Net Revenue** and **Revenue Growth**, and prepared date fields for time-based analysis.

### Building the Data Model
- Established relationships between key tables, such as **Orders**, **Products**, and **Customers**.
- Ensured the model supports dynamic and interactive analysis.

### Designing the Dashboard
- **KPIs**: Highlight key metrics like **Gross Revenue**, **Total Customers**, and **Orders** and more.
- **Visualizations**:
  - Line charts to show revenue trends.
  - Bar charts for top customers and employee performance.
  - Pie charts for region-wise analysis.
- **Filters and Slicers**: Allow users to explore data interactively by region, time period, and category.

## Insights and Takeaways
- The USA and Germany are the top revenue-generating countries.
- A small number of top customers drive a significant share of the revenue.
- Shipping costs vary significantly depending on the provider, highlighting optimization opportunities.
